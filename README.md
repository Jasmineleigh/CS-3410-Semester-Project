# Problem 1: 
What is the distance from point A to point B? 
What is the fastest route based on time, distance, or both? 
* Make a weighted graph where the weights are time and distance.
* The graph in this problem is the Valdosta State Campus.
* Outputs the fastest route for all of the possible parameters:
* time, distance, or distance and time
