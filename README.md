# Problem 1: 
What is the distance from point A to point B? 
What is the fastest route, cheapest route, best route that considers both the cheapest and the fastest route? 

Classes/ Methods needed?
  * Graph class that creates a graph given edges and nodes
  * a method to find fastest route from one point on the graph to any other point on the graph.
  * possibly a method the finds the longest route
  * possibly create a minimum spanning tree


# Problem 2:
Make our own version of Dijkstra's algorithm, and compare the time it takes for our version to Dijkstra's algorithm.
  * Make methods based on powerpoints from lecture
  * Make method(s) that are a modified version of a MST algorithm
  * Which is the slowest?
  * Which is executed better? why?
