# CS-3410-Semester-Project
# Problem 1: 
What is the distance from point A to point B? 
What is the fastest route based on time, distance, or both? 
* Make a weighted graph where the weights are time and distance.
* The graph in this problem is the Valdosta State Campus.
* Outputs the fastest route for all of the possible parameters:
* time, distance, or distance and time


# Problem 2:
Make our own version of Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm and compare it to Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm.
* Perform the inverse of Kruskal's Algorithm
* Delete the larger edges first if it doesn't disconnect the graph.
