Problem 1: 
What is the distance from point A to point B? 
What is the fastest route, cheapest route, best route that considers both the cheapest and the fastest route? 

Methods needed?
  * Create a weighted graph of locations or airports (the weights could be price or distance)
  * findFastestRoute
  * findCheapestRoute
  * ........?


Problem 2:
Make our own version of Dijkstra's algorithm, and compare the time it takes for our version to work to the time of Dijkstra's algorithm.
Make methods based on powerpoints from lecture
Make method that is the original Dijkstra algorithm
Make method(s) that are a modified version of the Dijkstra's algorithm
      * Which is the slowest?
      * Which is executed better? why?
      * .........?

Choose the method(s) you want to be responsible for, or add a method you think is needed to execute the problems.
