# Problem 1
Find the shortest path from one place on campus to another place on campus using time, distance, and ratings as the weights.
Time is the time it takes to get from one node to another.
Distance is the distance between one node to another node.
Ratings is a combination of time, distance, and safety of a particular path.

# Problem 2:
Make our own version of Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm and compare it to Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm.
* Perform the inverse of Kruskal's Algorithm
* Delete the larger edges first if it doesn't disconnect the graph.
